## Development Approach

When implementing these tasks, follow these principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Always start with writing tests before implementation
2. **Repository Pattern**: Separate data access logic from business logic
3. **Clean Architecture**: Ensure clear separation of concerns
4. **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations to support testing and flexibility
5. **Multi-Tenant Design**: Ensure all database operations consider the multi-tenant nature of the application

## Testing Strategy

For each repository:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test repository implementation against mocked database interactions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test repository implementation against a real test database
3. **Test Cases Coverage**: Ensure tests cover CRUD operations, pagination, filtering, error handling, and transaction rollback
