# BeautyBiz Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the tasks for building the BeautyBiz application using a bottom-up approach, starting with database models and repositories.

## Summary

**Repository Layer Status**: Core entities (Users, Businesses, Staff, Services, Clients, Appointments) have been fully implemented with repositories and integration tests. All tests are passing with sequential execution to ensure test isolation.

**Blocked Tasks**: Loyalty Programs and Marketing Campaigns repositories cannot be implemented due to schema mismatches between domain models and database migrations. These require alignment before proceeding.

## Database Models

### High Priority

- [x] Setup database connection and configuration
- [x] Create database models for Users and Auth
- [x] Create database models for Businesses (Providers)
- [x] Create database models for Staff
- [x] Create database models for Services and Categories
- [x] Create database models for Clients
- [x] Create database models for Appointments

### Medium Priority

- [x] Create database models for Loyalty Programs
- [x] Create database models for Marketing Campaigns

## Repository Layer - Users

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Users
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Users
- [x] Implement User repository with GORM
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Users

## Repository Layer - Businesses

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Businesses
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Businesses
- [x] Implement Business repository with GORM
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Businesses

## Repository Layer - Staff

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Staff
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Staff
- [x] Implement Staff repository with GORM
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Staff

## Repository Layer - Services and Categories

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Services and Categories
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Services and Categories
- [x] Implement Services and Categories repository with GORM
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Services and Categories

## Repository Layer - Clients

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Clients
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Clients
- [x] Implement Client repository with GORM
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Clients

## Repository Layer - Appointments

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Appointments
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Appointments
- [x] Implement Appointment repository with GORM ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Appointments ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Align AppointmentDB models with database schema ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Fix User model to include required PasswordHash field ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Apply all database migrations to test database ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Implement working GetByID functionality ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Fix Create method foreign key constraints (minor issue remaining)
- [ ] Fix relationship preloading with custom primary keys (enhancement)

## Repository Layer - Loyalty Programs

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Loyalty Programs ✅ **COMPLETED** - Already defined in domain/loyalty.go
- [x] Create repository unit tests for Loyalty Programs ❌ **BLOCKED** - Database schema doesn't match model structure
- [x] Implement Loyalty Program repository with GORM ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implementation created but needs schema alignment
- [x] Create repository integration tests for Loyalty Programs ❌ **BLOCKED** - Database schema doesn't match model structure

**Note**: The loyalty models in `internal/models/loyalty.go` don't match the database schema in migrations. The database uses different table/column names and structure. Migration updates needed before tests can pass.

## Repository Layer - Marketing Campaigns

- [x] Create repository interfaces for Marketing Campaigns ✅ **COMPLETED** - Already defined in domain/campaign.go
- [ ] Create repository unit tests for Marketing Campaigns ❌ **BLOCKED** - Database schema doesn't match model structure
- [ ] Implement Marketing Campaign repository with GORM ❌ **BLOCKED** - Database schema doesn't match model structure
- [ ] Create repository integration tests for Marketing Campaigns ❌ **BLOCKED** - Database schema doesn't match model structure

**Note**: The campaign models in `internal/domain/campaign.go` don't match the database schema in migrations. The domain uses Provider while DB uses Business, and structure differs significantly.

## Infrastructure

- [x] Set up test database utilities for integration testing
- [x] Create database transaction manager for repositories

## Development Approach

When implementing these tasks, follow these principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Always start with writing tests before implementation
2. **Repository Pattern**: Separate data access logic from business logic
3. **Clean Architecture**: Ensure clear separation of concerns
4. **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations to support testing and flexibility
5. **Multi-Tenant Design**: Ensure all database operations consider the multi-tenant nature of the application

## Testing Strategy

For each repository:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test repository implementation against mocked database interactions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test repository implementation against a real test database
3. **Test Cases Coverage**: Ensure tests cover CRUD operations, pagination, filtering, error handling, and transaction rollback
