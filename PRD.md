7. Critical Features - Detailed Specifications
7.1 Service Completion & Financial Tracking
The system will implement a frictionless approach to tracking business performance, especially for services paid in cash or other methods outside the platform:

Pre-Service Pricing:

When booking is confirmed, system calculates and displays expected service price
Both provider and client have visibility on expected cost
Option for provider to adjust final price based on actual services provided


Service Completion Triggers:

Automatic trigger: 15 minutes after scheduled end time
Manual provider trigger: "Service Completed" button
Manual client trigger: "Rate Your Experience" option
All triggers generate push notifications to the other party


Dual Confirmation Process:

Provider confirms service completion and can record payment details
Client confirms service received and can provide rating
System marks service as complete when both confirmations received
Reminder notifications if confirmation pending after 24 hours


Simple Payment Recording:

Provider indicates payment method (cash, card, transfer, other)
Records actual amount received
Option to note tips or additional charges
Digital receipt generation for client
No actual payment processing within platform


Performance Analytics:

Daily and weekly summaries of completed services
Revenue breakdowns by service type
Reconciliation between scheduled and completed services
Identification of no-shows or cancellations
Export functionality for accounting purposes



This approach provides valuable business insights without requiring the platform to handle actual payments, creating a lightweight solution that respects how most aestheticians currently operate in Portugal.

Program Types:

Visit-based (e.g., every 10th visit free)
Spending-based (e.g., 10% off after â‚¬500 spent)
